# description

SFCA ("Salesforce Code Analyzer") plugin performs static code analysis using popular tools such as PMD, ESLINT, RETIRE.Js, and more. This SFDX plugin takes the results of this analysis and uploads them to a specified commit in Bitbucket Server. This allows code reviewers to do a better analysis of the code, gaining valuable insights into the quality of the code being reviewed.

Note: Please make sure when running the `sfdx scanner:run` to provide the flag `--normalize-severity`, otherwise reported severities in the code insights may not match to the actual severity level.
